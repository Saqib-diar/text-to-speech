BEFORE:
You downloaded audio from ElevenLabs.
Wrote it to a physical file like public/output.mp3.
Served that file in HTML via <audio src="/output.mp3">.

NOW:
You stream the audio directly from ElevenLabs.
Convert it to base64 in memory.
Inject it into the <audio> tag as a data URI (no file needed).
